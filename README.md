Project Description:

Mood Indigo 

Music, Mood, and Weather application -

As a user, when I visit this page, I want to quickly and easily access a playlist that is generated based on the weather outside and my current mood. 

Mood Indigo is a mobile first app that connects the users emotions with suggestable playlist through Spotify based on the users local weather. The application utilizes the Spotify API to generate random playlist, ip-API to gather general geo-location, and Open Weather API to pull user local weather info.
